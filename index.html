        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration: Accounting</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">&emsp;Hello! My name is Melissa Lopez. I am on my second year at University of California, Riverside. I am pursuing my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting. I was born in Long Beach and grew up in South Central Los Angeles. I lived there my whole life, up until last year when I moved to Riverside for my education. I come from a big Mexican family, but my immediate family only consists of my mother and two sisters. I also have an older brother but the fact that he is twelve years older explains why were are not the closest. I am very family-orientated, and love my three nephews. They are my pride and soul. I am very close to my older sister. I look to her as a role model, mentor, and my best friend. However my biggest hero is my mother. I would not know where I would be if it was not for her full support.  One of my goals in life is to make my myself and mother proud through my accomplishments, which I do not plan to fail.<br><br>

        &emsp;I currently am working at the Undergraduate Admissions Office on campus. Through my job, I have received the chance to branch out professionally. This would be my first time at an office job, so I have gotten the opportunity to develop myself in a more professional setting. It has taught me how to formally talk to others in a higher authority. Through my job, I have also gotten the chance to meet new people. I am glad to be surrounded by such a supportive work environment and cooperative team. My job understands that we are students first and that the job comes second. <br><br>

        &emsp;I enjoy traveling, especially to Mexico. I love to visit my family at least once a year. I usually travel with my mother or sister. I feel like traveling with family is easy and simply the best. You get to create new memories, and you already know how your family is, so no surprises. I also enjoy spending time with my friends. My close friends, almost family at this point, are all back home in Los Angeles so I do not get to see them as often as I wish. So whenever I get a chance, I cherish the quality time we spend together. My hobbies include cooking, watching movies, and the occasional hike. I know it is important to take care of your physical health, but I can never stay consistent with the gym. A hike every once in a while helps clear my head and get in my exercise in a fun way. Cooking is another relaxing hobby for me. I am not the greatest chef, but I am slowly learning. My mother is a marvelous teacher, which makes learning so much more fun. It also gives an opportunity to bond more since I am away at college most of the time. Lastly, I think watching movies speaks for themselves. I just love being able to forget my stresses and allowing it to be more than just entertainment.
